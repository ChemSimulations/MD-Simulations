#### Theory of MD simulations 
Molecular dynamics (MD) is old technique and has evolved into an important and widely used theoretical tool that allows researchers in chemistry, physics, and biology to model the detailed microscopic dynamical behavior of many different types of systems, including gases, liquids, solids, surfaces, and clusters. **Berni Alder** and **Thomas Wainwright** used an **IBM 704** computer to simulate perfectly elastic collisions between hard spheres. In 1964, **Aneesur Rahman**, known as 'Father of Molecular Dynamics', published simulations of liquid argon that used a Lennard-Jones potential; calculations of system properties, such as the coefficient of self-diffusion, compared well with experimental data.
