#### Theory of MD simulations 
Molecular dynamics (MD) is old technique and has evolved into an important and widely used theoretical tool that allows researchers in chemistry, physics, and biology to model the detailed microscopic dynamical behavior of many different types of systems, including gases, liquids, solids, surfaces, and clusters. **Berni Alder** and **Thomas Wainwright** used an **IBM 704** computer to simulate perfectly elastic collisions between hard spheres. In 1964, **Aneesur Rahman**, known as 'Father of Molecular Dynamics', published simulations of [liquid argon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cudeposition.gif) that used a Lennard-Jones potential; calculations of system properties, such as the coefficient of self-diffusion, compared well with experimental data.

In a MD simulation, the classical equations of motion governing the microscopic time evolution of a many-body system are solved numerically subject to boundary conditions appropriate for the geometry or symmetry of the system. Thus, MD methodology is founded upon the basic principles of classical mechanics and can provide a window into the microscopic dynamical behavior of the individual atoms that make up a given system. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations not only offer detailed insights into the microscopic dynamical behavior of systems but also serve as a powerful tool for sampling from a statistical mechanical ensemble. This approach allows for the determination of equilibrium properties, such as average thermodynamic quantities (pressure, temperature, and volume), structural information, and free energy profiles along reaction pathways. The trajectories of atoms and molecules are obtained by solving newtons equation of motion

  **F** = m**a**, where **F** is the force and **a** is the accelaration

  Examples
 
 *Crude explantion of MD to Naive person:* Imagine a LBW (cricket), the ball hits the leg pads but to know whether it hits stumps or not, the trajectory of the ball is extended and shown as light color. Similarly, a static picture of atomic positions (protein or DNA or RNA) is obtained from experiments (XRD, NMR, or Cryo-EM), we solve newtons equation of motions to get the trjaectory of the molecule thus gaining insights into **Structure** and **Function**.

  **Proteins**
   An example of MD trajectory where protein is embedded in bilayer Membrane with water molecules above and below the bilayer. Water molecules are represented by $${\color{red}red}$$ color line representation, Membrane made up of POPC is represented by $${\color{cyan}cyan}$$ color and protein is represented by $${\color{red}red}$$ and $${\color{green}green}$$ color helix.
