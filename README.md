# MD Simulations Tutorial

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for setting up Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using a PDB structure downloaded from the [Protein Data Bank (PDB)](https://www.rcsb.org/). 

If the protein structure is not available in the PDB, we will cover how to predict the structure using various online tools and software, including:
- [SWISS-MODEL](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/)
- [AlphaFold](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)
- [I-TASSER](https://zhanggroup.org/I-TASSER/)
- (Modeller Software) [https://salilab.org/modeller/]
