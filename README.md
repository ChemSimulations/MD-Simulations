#### MD-Simulations
This tutorial will guide to set up MD simulations using a PBD structure downloaded from [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) and also to obtain the structure from sequence using various online servers such as [SWISSPDB](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/), AlphaFold(https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/), I-TASSER (https://zhanggroup.org/I-TASSER/)
