### MD-Simulations
This tutorial will guide to set up MD simulations using a PBD structure downloaded from [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) and also discusses about the cases that donot have structure in deposited in **PDB**. In the later case, we will model the structure using various online servers such as [SWISSPDB](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/), [AlphaFold](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/), [I-TASSER](https://zhanggroup.org/I-TASSER/) and Modeller Software
